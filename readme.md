A sample project allowing extremely basic management of customer order statuses.

Requires Java 8 or greater.

The project uses gradle and spring boot to build a self contained executable jar that starts on port 8080. An h2 database is generated 
and saved automatically in the running users home directory. Admin user and database user values can be configured in the application.properties file.
